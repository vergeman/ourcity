Ourcity San Diego Map Project

This is a basic sinatra app to demonstrate a leaflet.js map.

The editable app files are found in ./app.

    css/
	contains basic css stylings

    js/

	map.js: logic for leafleft.js

	San_Diego_Neighborhoods.js: contains geoJSON-formatted
	ourcityFeatures object.

I've minified and packed the assets, which are generated in The
/public directory. They contain both the generated files, and the
originals which they are based upon, following the same directory
structure as above. The "hashed" filenames represent the minified
code, and the app.js & application.css files are the minified, bundled
code.


/views:

contains the .erb file with html. Div's of interest are

#neighborhoods - the sided pane unordered list populated with
neighborhoods

#map - div where the map attaches.



==Misc Notes==
Edit files in app directory for asset precompile

Generate statics via: 
`rake assetpack:build` 

This repo's heroku remote is pushed using git subtree, to ignore/preserve the
qgis parent subdirectory. Go to project root (../ourcity)
     `git subtree push --prefix map heroku master`
